	<h2>Statistics</h2>

	<p class="large">Statistics is the science of analyzing and understanding
        <strong>data</strong> to make <strong>decisions</strong> in an
        <strong>ethical</strong> way.</p>



<ul>
<li>What kinds of data?
<li>What kinds of decisions?
<li>What ethical considerations?
<ul>


      </section>

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Populations</h2>

	We are often interested in a particular collection of objects:

<ul>
<li> All students at Marshall
<li> All deer in West Virginia
<li> All Ford Mustangs produced in 2019
<li> All bags of Doritos produced in a particular day
</ul>

<p>
The overall group of things we are interested in is called
the
<strong>population</strong>.</p>


      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Samples</h2>

<p>In most cases, we can't study the entire population.</p>

<ul>
<li> Too many to look at
<li> Geographical separation
<li> Cost
<li> Risk and safety
</ul>

<p>
If we study part of a population to understand the whole population,
the smaller group we study is called a <strong>sample</strong>.
</p>
      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Parameters vs. statistics</h2>

<p>A <strong>parameter</strong> is a numerical value that describes an
entire population.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Average GPA of all Marshall students
<li>Average gas mileage of all cars of a particular model
<li>Average weight of an adult male deer in West Virginia
</ul>

<p>A <strong>statistics</strong> is a numerical value that describes a
sample.</p>
<ul>
<li>Average GPA of students in one class
<li>Average gas mileage of three cars rented in different states
<li>Average weight of deer reported by hunters
</ul>

<p>We often want to use these sample statistics, which we can measure,
to estimate population paramameters that we can't measure.</p>

	<h2>Check your understanding</h2>

	<p>Identify the population, sample, parameter and statistic.</p>

<p> We want to know the average (mean) amount of mony first year college students spend at Marshall on school supplies that do not include books.  We randomly surveyed 100 first year students.  </p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Population

	    <ul class="fragment spaced">
	      <li class="green">All first year students at Marshall.
	    </ul>

	  <li>Sample

	    <ul class="fragment spaced">
	      <li class="green">The 100 students surveyed.
	    </ul>

	    <li>Parameter

	      <ul class="fragment spaced">
		<li class="green">The mean amount spent on school supplied, not books, by all Marshall first year students.
	      </ul>


	    <li>Statistic

	      <ul class="fragment spaced">
		<li class="green">The mean amount spent on school supplied, not books, by the 100 Marshall first year students in the sample.
	      </ul>


	      </ul>

	<h2>Ethical considerations</h2>

<p>From the American Statistical Association:</p>

<ul>
<li>Professional integrity
<li>Integrity of data and methods
<li>Responsibilities to Science/Public/Funder/Client
<li>Responsibilities to Research Subjects
<li>Responsibilities to Research Team Colleagues
<li>Responsibilities to Other Statisticians or Statistics Practitioners
<li>Responsibilities Regarding Allegations of Misconduct
<li>Responsibilities of Employers
</ul>

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Check your understanding</h2>

	<p>Identify which type of ethical consideratioin is being described.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>A researcher purposely leaves out a research subject when computing and reporting their findings.

	    <ul class="fragment spaced">
	      <li class="green">The researcher has violated the Integregy of Data and Methods guideline.
	    </ul>

	  <li>A researcher fails to get approval from their Institutional Research Board before performing an experiment on human subjects.

	    <ul class="fragment spaced">
	      <li class="green">The researcher has violated the Responsibilties to Research Subjects guideline.
	    </ul>

	    <li>A person is included in the list of authors of a research paper who did not assist on the research or paper.

	      <ul class="fragment spaced">
		<li class="green">The researcher who included this person has violated the Professional Integrity and Accountability guideline.
	      </ul>
