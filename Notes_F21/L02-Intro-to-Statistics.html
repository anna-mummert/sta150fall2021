	<h2>Random sampling</h2>

	<p>This lesson is about ways to create a random sample
	from a population.</p>


	<p>This topic is part of <b>experimental design</b>, which
	  refers to the process <br/> of designing a statistical study so
	  that the results will be meaningful.</p>

      </section>


      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Convenience sampling</h2>

	<p>The easiest way to make a random sample is to use
	   a sample that is easy to collect.</p>

	<p>This is called <b>convenience sampling</b>.</p>

	<ul class="spaced">
	  <li> In order to study student preferences about their classes,<br/>
	    I only interview students that are in my classes.

	  <li> In order to measure the prices of soft drinks,
	    I drive to the closest Wal-Mart and write down
	    their prices.


	    </ul>

<p>Convenience sampling is also called <b>opportunity sampling</b>.

      </section>



      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>Simple random sampling</h2>

	<p>In simple random sampling, each member of the population
	   has the same chance of being chosen.</p>

	<p>Suppose we have a population of 50 students and
	  we want to select 10.</p>

      </section>


      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Simple random sampling</h2>

	<p>Here is one possible selection of 10 individuals.</p>

	<img src="Figures/simple-1.png"
	     alt="A single population of 50 individuals with 10 individuals randomly selected"/>

	<p>There are many other choices of 10 individuals. <br/>The important point
	  is that everyone had the same chance of being selected.</p>

      </section>



      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Methods for random sampling</h2>

	<p>It is not possible to make random samples by
	  choosing the sample yourself.<br/>
	  You need to use a better method.</p>

	<ul class="spaced">

	  <li> Put each person's name on a piece of paper, place the
	    papers in a bag or box, and select the appropriate number.

	  <li> Use a computer or table to assign each person in the
	  population a number between 1 and 100, and then select a set
	  of numbers to get the right number of people in your sample.

	  <li> Take a set of note cards. Mark some with an X and leave
	    the rest blank.  Shuffle the note cards and give one to
	    each person. The people with a marked card are the ones
	    in the sample.

	  <li> There are many other methods that will work, as well

	</ul>

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Stratified sampling</h2>

	<p>Because we don't control who is selected in a simple random
	  sample,<br/> the sample will represent the <em>overall</em>
	  population, but it may not represent<br/> any
	  particular <em>subpopulation</em>.</p>

	<p>If we select 400 Marshall students at random, we are not
	likely to get 100 Freshman,<br/> 100 Sophomores, 100 Juniors, and
	100 Seniors.</p>

	<p><b>Stratified sampling</b> divides the population into groups
	  <br/>
	  and takes a random sample from each group.</p>

	<img src="Figures/stratified.png" alt="A population with four groups: Freshman, Sophomores, Juniors, Seniors. A random sample is taken separately from each group."/>

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Cluster sampling</h2>

	<p><b>Cluster sampling</b> is a different way to make a sample
	when the population is divided into groups.</p>

	<p>In cluster sampling, we select some of the groups, and then
	  the sample consists of all the individuals who are in the selected
	  groups.</p>

	<p>For example, we might select 8 classes at Marshall and then
	  interview all of the students in each of the classes.
	  </p>

      </section>



      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Stratified vs. cluster <br/> sampling</h2>

	<p>There is an important difference between stratified and
	  cluster sampling.</p>

	<ul class="spaced">

	  <li> In <b>stratified sampling</b>, we take a separate
	      random sample from every group.

	    <ul class="fragment normal">

	      <li class="green">This is most useful when we want to ensure that our
		  sample contains a sufficient number of people from
		each group.

		<li class="green"> For example, a medical study might want to
		include both women and men, or both old and young
		people.

		<li class="green"> A study at Marshall might want to include
		students from all the colleges.
	      </ul>

	  <li> In <b>cluster sampling</b>, we select some of the
	    groups, and the sample consists of every member of these
	    groups.

	    <ul class="normal fragment">

	      <li class="green">This is most useful when the groups
		are separated by time or distance.

	      <li class="green">For example, we might want to
		interview residents at several nursing homes. If it is
		too difficult to travel to too many nursing homes, a
		cluster sample might reduce our travel time.

	      <li class="green">We need to ask if the groups selected are representative
		of the overall population.
	    </ul>

	<h2>Check your understanding</h2>

	<p>Identify which type of sampling is being described.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>20 Marshall students are selected for a survey by
	    randomly choosing their names from the list of enrolled students.

	    <ul class="fragment spaced">
	      <li class="green">Assuming each student has the same chance of being selected, this is a simple random sample.
	    </ul>

	  <li>I measure student satisfaction with the cafeteria by
	    going there one Tuesday and asking the people I see to
	    complete a survey.

	    <ul class="fragment spaced">
	      <li class="green">This is a convenience sample.
	    </ul>

	    <li>The state studies elementary schools by sending a team
	      to visit 15 different schools across the state. The team then
	      evaluates the records of all students at each of the schools.

	      <ul class="fragment spaced">
		<li class="green">This is a cluster sample.
	      </ul>


	    <li>The state studies elementary schools by randomly
	    selecting 10 students from every school in the state, and
	    then evaluating the records of the selected students.

	      <ul class="fragment spaced">
		<li class="green">This is a stratified sample.
	      </ul>


	      </ul>

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
        <h2>Systematic sampling</h2>

	<p>A different kind of sampling is often used for quality control.</p>

	<p>Imagine that many items are being produced on an
	  assembly line.

	<p>In <b>systematic sampling</b> we select our sample items at a
	fixed rate.</p>
	<ul class="normal">

	  <li>We may select every 100th item, or every 10,000th item.

	  <li>We may select one item every half hour, or every hour,
	  or every day.

	</ul>

	<p>For example, a soda factory may select every 5,000th bottle
	  to inspect for quality control.

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
        <h2>Multistage sampling</h2>

	<p><b>Multistage sampling</b> uses a combination of several sampling
	methods.</p>


	<p>For example, if we want to study the WV school system,
	  we might:
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>First select 30 schools at random
	  <li>Then select 10 classes from each of those schools at random
	  <li>Then select all students from each of those classes
	</ul>

	<p>The field of experimental design studies the best ways
	  to design these studies.
