        <h2>Representative samples </h2>

	<p>One question about any sample is whether it
	is <b>representative</b> of the overall population.</p>

	<p>A <b>representative sample</b> has properties that match
	  those of the larger group well enough for facts about the sample
	  to tell us about the overall population.
	</p>

	<p>Any reason that the sample is not representative is
	  called <b>bias</b>.</p>

	<p>Unlike regular English, this meaning of
	  "bias" in statistics is not only negative.</br>
	  Some bias is unavoidable.
	</p>

	<p>One goal of experimental design is to reduce any bias that can be
	  anticipated in the study.</p>


	</section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
        <h2>Sampling bias</h2>

	<p><b>Sampling bias</b> is caused by the fact that a random
	sample may not always match the population perfectly.</p>

	<p> Although it is unlikely, a random sample could be unlucky and
	fail to match the overall population.</p>

	<p>Sampling bias can occur even if a study is perfectly
	designed and perfectly carried out.</p>

	<p>This is one reason you see "plus or minus"
	  in the results of opinion polls.</p>

        <h2>Design bias</h2>

	<p><b>Design bias</b> is caused by using an inappropriate
	sampling technique.</p>

	<p>Design bias happens when the method used are not reliable,
	  even if the method is carried out perfectly.</p>

	<p>Using a convenience sample is an example of design bias.</p>



	</section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
        <h2>Opportunity bias</h2>

	<p><b>Opportunity bias</b> happens when not all members of the
	population have the same ability to participate.</p>

	<p>For example, a survey carried out in the dorms will not
	  collect data from commuter students.</p>

	<p>A poll that calls people on their home telephone will
	  not contact anyone who doesn't have a home telephone.</p>

        <h2>Volunteer bias</h2>

	<p><b>Volunteer bias</b> happens when members of the
	  population have to go out of their way to volunteer for a
	  study.
	</p>

	<p>For example, if a radio station asks listeners to call in
	and express their opinions, only listeners with strong
	opinions are likely to call in.</p>

	<p>Volunteer bias happens when participants choose themselves
	  for the study, rather than being chosen ahead of time. </p>

      </section>

      <section class="left">

	<h2>Non-response bias</h2>

	<p><b>Non-response bias</b> happens when some members of the population
	<br/> who were selected for a study decline to participate.</p>

	<p>This may happen if the members are concerned the
	study might harm them, expose personal information, or lead to
	embarrassment.</p>

	<p>For example, high school students who drink alcohol
	  might choose not to be interviewed about their alcohol use
	  if they think the interviewer might tell their parents.</p>


	<p>Because we cannot require participants to take part in a
	study, non-response bias is sometimes unavoidable.</p>

	</section>


      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
        <h2>Check your understanding</h2>

	<p>Identify the kind of bias in each situation. There may be more than one.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>To measure student health, I select 10 Marshall students
	  at random. After I make the selection, I realize the
	  students I selected are all student athletes.</li>
	  <ul class="fragment spaced">
	    <li class="green">This is sampling bias.  Although I am
	    not likely to select 10 athletes using a purely random
	      process, there is a very small chance that I could do so.
	      A larger sample size makes this more unlikely
	  </ul>

	  <li>To measure how all Marshall students like their classes,
	    all professors hand out paper surveys during class
	    for their students
	    to return to Old Main.
	    <ul class="fragment spaced">

	      <li class="green">There is opportunity bias because
	      online students are not given the survey.

	      <li class="green">There is volunteer and non-response
		bias because some students may decide not to return
		the surveys, while those with strong feelings are more
		likely to do so.

	      <li class="green">There is volunteer bias because the students
		have to go out of their way to return the surveys to Old Main.
	  </ul>


	</section>

      <section class="left">
        <h2>Some bias is unavoidable</h2>

	<p>Some bias is unavoidable.</p>

	<ul class="spaced">
	  <li>Sampling bias, by its nature, cannot be avoided. An
	  important part of statistics comes from managing sampling
	  bias, as we will see.

	  <li>In some cases, the budget for a study does not allow for
	    a purely random sample. For example, if a study requires
	    personal interviews, a clustered sample may be needed to
	    reduce travel costs.

	  <li class="fragment">Statistical studies on humans
	      require <b>informed consent</b>. Individuals may always
	      opt out of a study, leading to non-response bias.


	    <li class="fragment">Studies that have high costs may require very small
	    sample sizes. For example, it is not economical  to select
	    one car in 100 for destructive crash safety testing. </li>

	</ul>

      </section>
            <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Variables</h2>

	<p>In statistics, we can collect many different kinds of data. </p>

	<p>Imagine we collect data about 500 students graduating one spring.</p>

	<p>We might record the following data:</p>

	<ul class="spaced">
	  <li> The name of each student
	  <li> The GPA of each student, from 2.00 to 4.00
	  <li> The class rank of each student, from 1 to 500
	</ul>

	<p>Each piece of info we collect is called a <b>variable</b>. </p>

	<p>A variable represents a particular
	piece of information (data) that we want to study.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="left">
	<h2>Kinds of variables</h2>

	<p>The type of data of each variable tells what we can do with it.<p>

	  <ul class="spaced">
	<li>We can count the number of students named 'Joshua'.

	<li> We can combine the GPAs to find the average GPA of all the students.

	<li>We can't find the 'average name' of the students!
	  </ul>
      </section>



      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>Qualitative variables</h2>

	<p>A variable that is not numerical is called <b>qualitative</b>.</p>

	<p>For example:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Name
	  <li>County of Birth
	  <li>Major
	  <li>Gender
	</ul>

	<p>Qualitative variables are also called <b>categorical variables</b>,
<br/>	  because they refer to different "categories" of data points.</p>

      </section>


      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
      <section class="left">

	<h2>Quantitative variables</h2>

	<p>Most numerical variables are <b>quantitative</b>. They represent positions on a number line.</p>

	<p>For quantitative variables, the order of the numbers matters, and
	  it is legitimate to do arithmetic (like subtracting and/or finding percentages) with the numbers.
	</p>

	<p>For example:</p>
	<ul class="spaced">
	  <li> Age is a quantitative variable. Age 30 is older than age 25, and it makes sense to
	    do arithmetic with ages.
	  <li> GPA is a quantitative variable. It makes sense to arrange GPAs in order, and we can
	    do arithmetic with them.
	  <li>Suppose we flip a coin 5 times and count the number of heads. This is a quantitative
	    variable. We know 3 heads is more then 1 head, and it makes sense to repeat the experiment
	    and find the average number of heads.
	</ul>

      </section>


      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
      <section class="left">

	<h2>Numerical categorical<br/> variables</h2>

	<p>A few numerical variables are categorical, though.</p>

	<p>This happens when the numbers are just arbitrary labels.  The variables are coded by the numbers.</p>

	<p>For example:</p>
	<ul class="spaced">
	  <li>West Virginia has three congressional districts. If we label them 1, 2, and 3,
	    the order is meaningless. The three districts could have been numbered in any order.
	    Also, we can't do arithmetic on them - we can't average 2 and 3 to get district 2.5.

	  <li>If we make a survey of students in which we write '1' for freshmen, '2' for sophomores,
	    '3' for juniors, and '4' for seniors, this data is categorical, even though we use numbers.
	</ul>
	</section>




      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>Levels of measurement</h2>

	<p>The level of measurement of the variable tells us what statistics we can do with it.</p>

  <p>In this class we'll use these four <b>levels of measurement</b> to describe
	  variables with more detail:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Nominal variables
	  <li>Ordinal variables
	  <li>Discrete variables
	  <li>Continuous variables
	</ul>



      </section>



      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
      <section class="left">

	<h2>Nominal  variables</h2>

	<p><b>Nominal variables</b> are simply labels for categories. </p>

	<p>They
	  have no meaningful order, and we cannot do arithmetic with them.</p>

	<p>Examples of nominal variables include:</p>
	  <ul class="spaced">
	    <li>Name
	    <li>High school
	    <li>WV Congressional District 1, 2, or 3
	  </ul>

	<p><b>How to tell:</b> Nominal data are categorical data, with no ordering.  </p>

      </section>

      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
      <section class="left">

	<h2>Ordinal  variables</h2>

	<p><b>Ordinal variables</b> come in a natural order, but we can't
	  subtract them or compare percentages.</p>

<p> Ordinal variables are also qualitative variables, but with a natural ordering. </p>

	<p><b>How to tell:</b> Subtracting ordinal data points does not give a meaningful
	  result.</p>

	<p>Examples of ordinal variables include:</p>

	  <ul class="spaced">
	    <li>Students are asked whether they Strongly Agree, Agree,
	      Disagree, or Strongly Disagree with a particular statement.
	      We know 'Agree' is higher than 'Disagree', but we can't
	      subtract to find out "how much" higher.

	    <li>Class ranks for graduating students.
	      We know that class rank 1 is higher than class rank 20,
	      but differences aren't meaningful. The difference
	      from student 1 to student 20 might be more, or less,
	      than the difference from student 20 to student 40. We
	      have no idea from the rankings alone.

	    <li>Grades on an A/B/C/D/F scale. We know B is higher than C, but
	      it makes no sense to subtract one letter grade from another. We don't know
	      the original numeric grades.
	  </ul>

      </section>

      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
      <section class="left">
  <h2>Discrete Variables </h2>



  <b>Discrete</b> numerical variables can only take on specific values, which are usually
      evenly spaced.

  <p><b>How to tell:</b> In this class, we'll use discrete variables when we count things.  <p>

      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>If we count the number of classes each graduating student has taken, this is a discrete
    variable. It is not possible to take a fractional number of classes.
        <li>If we flip a coin 5 times and count the number of heads, this is a discrete variable.
      </ul>



      </section>

      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
      <section class="left">
  <h2>Continuous variables </h2>

<b>Continuous</b> variables can take on any value in a range.

<p><b>How to tell:</b> In this class, we'll use continuous variables for any quantitiative variables that is not a counting (discrete) variable.  <p>

      <ul class="spaced">

      <li>If we measure the weight of each truck passing a
      certain point on the road, this is a continuous
      variable. The weight of the truck can be any number in a
      large range.

      <li>If we measure hospital patients' temperature to the nearest 0.01 degree,
        we treat this as a continuous variable.  Although we are rounding, the number of possible
        values is very large, and the difference between consecutive temperatures is very low.

      <li>If a variable can have a very large number of values on a number line, we typically
        treat it as continuous, even if not all values are possible.

      </ul>


      </section>




      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
      <section class="left">
  <h2>Other Levels of measurement</h2>

<p> Many classifications of variables into levels of measurements exist</p>

<p>Classify data by what statistics you can do with the variables.<p>

<p> Stevens levels (Wikipedia: Level of measurement)
  <ul>
    <li>Nominal variables
    <li>Ordinal variables
    <li>Interval variables (difference between data is meaningful)
    <li>Ratio variables (computing percentages is meaningful)
  </ul>


<p> Modern, data science levels (7 Data Types, Jeff Hale, TowardDataScience.com)
  <ul> <li>useless, nominal, binary, ordinal, count, time, interval, image, video, audio, and text.
</ul>

      </section>


      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
<!--      <section class="left">

	<h2>Interval variables</h2>

	<p><b>Interval variables</b> are variables that come with a natural
	  order.</p>

	<p><b>Hot to tell:</b> the difference found by subtracting data points is meaningful.</p>

	<p>Examples of interval variables include:</p>

	  <ul class="spaced">
	    <li>Temperature of patients in a hospital.  We know that 100.4&deg; is higher
	      than 98.6&deg;, and it makes sense to subtract to say it is 0.8&deg; higher.
	      Similarly 102&deg; is 0.8&deg; hotter than 101.2&deg;

	    <li>The day of the year. We know there are 10 days from August 4 to August 12, and
	      10 days from April 15 to April 25. So we can find the distance (difference in time)
	      between two dates.

	  </ul>

      </section>

-->
      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
  <!--    <section class="left">

	<h2>Ratio variables</h2>

	<p><b>Ratio variables</b> are numerical variables where <br/>
	  we can both subtract data points
	  and compute percentages meaningfully.</p>

	<p><b>How to tell:</b> Ratio variables have a "true zero".</p>

	<p>Examples of ratio variables include:</p>

	  <ul class="spaced">
	    <li>The length of trout in a river is a ratio variable. A trout that is 12 inches
	      is 4 inches longer, and 50 percent longer, than a trout that is 8 inches long.
	      Although no trout is 0 inches long, it is true that 0 inches is "no length".
	      A baby trout is almost 0 inches long.
	    <li>The time it takes a runner to finish a one-mile race is a ratio variable.
	      If one runner takes 6 minutes, and another runner takes 8 minutes,
	      the faster runner was both 2 minutes faster (subtracting) and 25% faster (dividing).
	      Although it is impossible to run a mile in 0 minutes, it is true that 0 minutes is "no time".
	      A rocket takes almost 0 minutes to travel one mile.
	  </ul>

      </section>
-->

      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
  <!--    <section class="left">

	<h2>Interval variables and true zero</h2>

	<p>There is a way to distinguish interval variables from ratio variables.</p>

	<p><b>Test:</b> Interval variables do not have a true zero.</p>

	<p>Examples of interval data:</p>

     <ul>
       <li>Temperature. We cannot say that an 80 degree day is "twice as hot" as a 40 degree day.
	 <br/> A temperature of zero degrees Fahrenheit does not mean "no temperature" or "no heat".


       <li>The day of the year.  January 1 is not the first day of time; it is just one day
	 later than the previous December 31. There is no fixed zero point in the cycle of days of the year,
	 only a repeating pattern.

       <li>SAT scores. There is no true zero for SAT scores. The lowest possible score is 200.
	 A score of 600 does not represent "twice as much correctness" as a score of 300, because
	 the raw scores were adjusted to fit the 200-800 scale.

     </ul>

	<p>Note: We cannot compare interval data using percent change or percent difference.<br/> This is
	  key distinction between ratio and interval data.</p>

      </section>

      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
      <section class="left">

	<h2>Levels of measurement in SPSS</h2>

	<p>SPSS has only three levels of measurement:</p>

	<ul class="spaced">
	  <li><b>Nominal,</b> the same as we have discussed.
	  <li><b>Ordinal,</b> the same as we have discussed.
	  <li><b>Scale</b>. In SPSS, scale data includes both discrete and continuous data.
	    </ul>

      </section>



      <!-- ------------------------------------------------ -->
      <section class="left">

	<h2>Levels of measurement revisited</h2>

	<p>We can think of levels of measurement as properties of data variables.</p>

	<p>We can also view levels of measurement as properties of <b>the
	  way the data was measured.</b><p>

	  <ul class="spaced">
	    <li>If we record student final class grades as 'passing' or 'failing', or as A/B/C/D/F,<br/>
	      we will have ordinal data.
	    <li>If we record the same final grades on a scale of 0 to 100, we will have continuous data.
	  </ul>

	<p>When you design a statistical study, it is important to use the right
	  level of measurement<br/> so you can perform the desired statistical analysis.
	</p>

	<p>This is why we distinguish between different levels of measurement.</p>

	<p>Use the terminology from this lesson to say as much as you can about each of these
	  variables:</p>

		<li class="green"> Although the number of points must be a whole number,
