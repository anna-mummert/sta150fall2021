      <section class="left">
<h2>Central Tendency</h2>

<p>We use the term <em>central tendency</em> to describe
the "average" or "typical" value of a data set.
</p>

<p>There are several ways to talk about the average,
which apply in different situations.
</p>

      </section>


      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">

<h2>Mode</h2>

<p>For categorical data, there are not may ways to measure the &ldquo;center&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>The most common data value is called the <em>mode</em>. In some cases,
this is an informative measure.</p>

<ul class="spaced">
<li>The most common college for STA 150 students is the College of Business.

<li>The most common family name in South Korea is <em>Kim</em>,
   with about 21.5 percent of their population. The next most common, <em>Lee</em>,
	isused by about 14.7 percent of the population.

</ul>

<p>For scale data, we don't normally talk about the mode. We use other
measures.</p>

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
<h2>Median</h2>

<p>The <em>median</em> represents the middle of the data when it is
sorted in order.
</p>

<p>When there are an odd number of data points, the median is the
middle value.</p>

<ul class="spaced">
<li>The median of 12, 14, 17, 19, 21 is 17
<li>The median of 9, 9, 10, 12, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19 is 12
</ul>

<p class="fragment">When there are an even number of data points, the median is halfway
between the middle two points.</p>

<ul class="fragment spaced">
<li>The median of 20, 30, 40, 50 is 35, halfway between 30 and 40.
<li>The median of 3, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10 is 5, halfway between 4 and 6.
</ul>

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
<h2>Mean</h2>

<p>The <em>mean</em> of a data set is made by adding the values
and dividing by the number of values.
</p>

<ul class="spaced">
<li>For the data set 4, 8, 10, 14, the total is 36.
<br/>The mean is 36 / 4 = 9.
<li class="fragment">For the data set 20, 25, 30, 45, 50,
the total is 170, and the mean is 170 / 5 = 34.
</ul>

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->

      <section class="left">
      <h2>Check your understanding</h2>

      <p>Identify the mode, median, and mean of the following data.</p>

\[12 \quad 13 \quad 16 \quad 19 \quad 19 \quad 21 \]

      <ul>
      <li>Mode

      <ul class="fragment spaced">
        <li class="green">19
      </ul>

      <li>Median

      <ul class="fragment spaced">
        <li class="green">17.5
      </ul>

      <li>Mean

        <ul class="fragment spaced">
      <li class="green">16.7 (round to one more decimal place than the data)
        </ul>



        </ul>

<h2>Notation for the mean</h2>

<p>In statistics, we use special notation to describe some of our computations.<p>

<p>We let $N$ stand for the size of a sample or data set.</p>

<p>We use variables like $x$ and $y$ to stand for the data. These are
sometimes called <em>random variables</em>.  </p>

<p>In algebra, a variable stands for a single number. In statistics,
a variable stands for the entire set of data. </p>

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
<h2>Notation for the mean</h2>

<p>We use the $\sum$ symbol to mean &ldquo;Add these values&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>So, if $x$ stands for a data set, the notation
\[
\sum x
\]
means to add the values of the data set.
</p>

<p>In this notation, the mean value of a data set is
\[
\frac{\sum x}{N}
\]</p>

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
<h2>Notation for the mean</h2>

<p>Because the mean is used so often, it has special notation.<p>

<p>If $x$ stands for a data set, we let $\bar x$ represent the mean of the data set.</p>

<p>So we have the formula
\[
\bar x =
\frac{\sum x}{N}
\]
</p>
      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
<h2>Sensitivity to outliers</h2>

<p><em>Outliers</em> are data points that are very different from the others
&ndash; much larger or much smaller.</p>

<p>For example, consider a group of people whose heights, in inches, are
62, 62, 64, 66, and 78. <p>

<p>The person who is 78 inches tall is an outlier in this group.</p>

<p>The median height is 64. Half the group is shorter than the median, and half is taller than the median.<p>

<p>The mean height is 68. All but one person in the group is shorter than the mean height.</p>


      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
<h2>Outliers example</h2>

<p>To show the effect of outliers, we will look at data from
the Congressional Budget Office (<em>
<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55413">The Distribution of
Household Income, 2016</a></em> released in July 2019).
</p>

<p>The CBO divided the population into 5 groups, each of which have the
same number of households. The population was divided by household income after
taxes and transfers were taken into account.
<p>

<p>So these numbers represent income <em>after taxes</em>, but <em>including</em>
benefits such as SNAP, Medicaid, etc.</p>
</section>

<h2>2016 U.S. Household Income Data</h2>

<p>Each group includes the same number of households.</p>

<p>Average income of each group of households:</p>
<ul>
<li>First 20%: $35,000
<li>Second 20%: $48,000
<li>Third 20%: $66,000
<li>Fourth 20%: $92,000
<li>Fifth 20%: $215,000
</ul>

<h2>2016 U.S. Household Income Bar Chart</h2>

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
<h2>Comparing the median and mean</h2>

<p>The <em>median</em> U.S. household income in 2016 from this data was $66,000.
<p>

<p>The <em>mean</em> U.S. household income in 2016 from this data was
$91,200.</p>

<p>The median represents a line halfway from the least household
income to the highest.
</p>

<p>The mean is the number that you would multiply by the number of
households to find the total household income in the U.S.
</p>

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Overall, the median is not very sensitive to outliers.<p>

<p>For example, if we throw out the same number of data points
at the top and bottom of the data, the median is unchanged.</p>

<p>The mean is relatively sensitive to outliers. A large change in just
a few data points can cause notable changes in the mean.</p>

      </section>



      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
<h2>Normally distributed data</h2>

<p>Later in the course, we will see that many data sets have
what is called a <em>normal distribution</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heights of people in a large population
<li>Weights of birds in a large flock of birds
<li>Scores of a large population on a standardized exam
</ul>

<p>For normally distributed data, the median and the mean will
be the same, or almost the same.</p>

      </section>
