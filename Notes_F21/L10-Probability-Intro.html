	<h2>Probability</h2>

<p> Probability is a mathematical tool used to study randomness.</p>

<p> Probability is a measure associated with how certain we are of an outcome of a particular experiment (activity, event).  </p>

<p> Probabilities give us a systematic approach to "guess" about the outcome of an event in order to make a decision.</p>


      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>Experiment</h2>

<p>A random exeriment is a procedure to obtain an outcome from a collection of possible outcomes.</p>

<p> The set of all possible outcomes is the sample space.</p>

<ul class="spaced">
<li> In some cases you can write out all possible outcomes.
  <ul> <li>Flip two coins - the possible outcomes are (head, head), (head, tail), (tail, head), (tail, tail).
  </ul>
</li>
<li> In some cases you cannot list all possible outcomes.
<ul> <li>Similar to sampling -- too many individuals, too expensive  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p> An event is the set of outcomes you are interested in.
  <ul> <li>What is the probability that when I flip two coins, the result is one head and one tail? (head,tail) or (tail,head)  </li>
  </ul>
</p>
      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>Probability</h2>

<p>A probability is a number between 0 and 1 that tells you how often an event will happen if you peform the experiment many times, the long-term relative frequency.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Probabiliy 0 means the event never happens
<li> Probabilities closer to 0 mean the event happens less often
  <li> Probabilities closer to 1 mean the event happens more often
  <li> Probability 1 means the even always happens
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you can write out all possible outcomes, then you can compute the theoretical (exact) probability of an event.  </p>

<p> If you cannot list all possible outcomes, you need to compute the long-term relative frequency of the event.  Estimate probability of population from sample probability. </p>


</section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>OR events</h2>

<p>In mathematics, "or" means one, or the other, or both.</p>

<p> An outcome is in the event "A or B" if the outcome is in A, or the outcome is in B, or the outcome is in both A and B.  </p>

<p> Example -- A student at Marshall is a first-generation student (A) or a first year student (B).

<p> Caution!  Very often in English "or" means "exclusive or" -- one or the other, but not both.



      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>And events</h2>

<p> An outcome is in the event "A and B" if the outcome is in both A and B at the same time.  </p>

<p> Example -- A student at Marshall is a first-generation student (A) and a first year student (B).

</section>


<!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section class="left">
<h2>Multiplication Principle</h2>

<p> A compound experiment $E$ is a larger experiment consisting of two smaller experiments $E_1$ and $E_2$ that do not affect each other.
</p>

<p> The number of outcomes of $E$ is the product of the number of outcomes of $E_1$ and the number of outcomes of $E_2$.  </p>

<p>Example -- $E_1$ flip one coin, $E_2$ flip a second coin.
<ul>
  <li> The result of either coin has no affect on the other coin.
  <li> $n_1 = 2$ and $n_2 = 2$, so the compound experiment has $n = 4$ possible outcomes
    <ul> <li>Flip two coins - the possible outcomes are (head, head), (head, tail), (tail, head), (tail, tail).
    </ul>
</ul>


</section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>Complement events</h2>

<p>The complement of event A consists of all outcomes that are not in A.  </p>

<p>Example -- event A is "roll a 5 or 6" when rolling one six-sided die.  The complement is "roll a 1, 2, 3, or 4" (anthing but a 5 or 6).

<p> Example - a Marshall student is a first year student.  The complement event is "a student is not a first year student".

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>General Probability Formula</h2>

\[\text{Probability of an event} = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes in the event}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \]
<br>

<p> What is the probability a Marshall student is an undergraduate student?

<p> Experiment -- determine the undergrad / grad status of each student

<p> Outcome of interest -- undergraduate

<p> In Fall 2019, Marshall had a total of 12,862 students (https://www.marshall.edu/quick-facts/, Accessed 2021.07.05) of which 9,422 were undergraduates.

<p> The probability that a randomly selected student at Marshall, in fall 2019, was an undergraduate is
  \[P = \frac{9,422}{12,862} = 0.733 = 73.3\% \]

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
  <h2>Law of Large Numbers</h2>

  <p>The law of large numbers states that as the number of repetitions of an experiment is increased, the relative frequency obtained in the experiment becomes closer to the theoretical probability.</p>

<p> Example -- Roll one six-sided die.

<p> The theoretical probability of rolling a 1 (or any other number) is 1/6.

<p> If you roll a six-sided die <b>a lot</b>, the relative frequency will be close to 1/6.

      <h2>Check your understanding</h2>

      <p>True or False.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>An event with probability 0 will never happen.

      <ul class="fragment spaced">
        <li class="green">True
      </ul>

      <li>An event with probability larger than 0 is guaranteed to happen (will certainly happen).

      <ul class="fragment spaced">
        <li class="green">False
      </ul>

      <li> An event A that has a larger probability than event B is more likely to happen.

        <ul class="fragment spaced">
      <li class="green">True
        </ul>


      <li>Given a data set, the relative frequency of an event is the probability of the event.

        <ul class="fragment spaced">
      <li class="green">True
        </ul>

        <li>You could find an event that has probability 3.

          <ul class="fragment spaced">
        <li class="green">False
          </ul>

        </ul>
