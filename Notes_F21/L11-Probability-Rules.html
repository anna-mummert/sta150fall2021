      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>Probability</h2>

<p>A probability is a number between 0 and 1 that tells you how often an event will happen if you peform the experiment many times, the long-term relative frequency.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Probabiliy 0 means the event never happens
<li> Probabilities closer to 0 mean the event happens less often
  <li> Probabilities closer to 1 mean the event happens more often
  <li> Probability 1 means the even always happens
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you can write out all possible outcomes, then you can compute the theoretical (exact) probability of an event.  </p>

<p> If you cannot list all possible outcomes, you need to compute the long-term relative frequency of the event.  </p>


</section>

  <!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section class="left">
<h2>Basic facts</h2>

<ul class="spaced">
  <li> The total probability of the entire spample space (all possible outcomes) is 1 </li>
  <li> For any event, $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$ </li>
  <li> For any event A with probability $P(A)$, the complement of $A$, $A^c$, has probability $1 - P(A)$
    \[P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) \]

</ul>


<p>


</section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>Independent events</h2>

<p>Two events are independent if the probability of each one occurring does not depend on whether the other one ocurred.</p>


<p>Multiplication rule for independent events:
  \[P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]
<br>

<p> Example -- roll a six-sided die and flip a fair coin.  What is the probability that we flip heads and roll a 4?
  <ul>
    <li> Flipping a coin and rolling a die are independent -- the probability of one does not depend on whether the other occurred.
    <li> P(flip heads) = 1/2 and P(roll 4) = 1/6
    <li> P(flip heads and roll 4) = (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12
</ul>

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>Mutually exclusive events</h2>

<p> Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both occur at the same time.   </p>

<p> Two events are mutually exclusive if the probability they both occur at the same time (A and B) is 0
\[P(A \text{ and } B) = 0 \]

<p> Addition rule for mutually exclusive events:
  \[P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) \]
</p>

<br>

<p> Example -- Roll a six-sided die.  What is the probability that you roll a 2 or an odd number?
  <ul>
    <li> Rolling a 2 and rolliing an odd number are mutually exclusive -- they cannot occur at the same time.
    <li> P(roll 2) = 1/6 and P(roll odd) = 1/2
    <li> P(roll 2 or roll odd) = 1/6 + 1/2 = 4/6 = 2/3
</ul>


</section>


<!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section class="left">
<h2>General Addition Rule</h2>

<p>For any events $A$ and $B$
\[P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ or } B) \]  </p>

<p>Idea: "or" counts events in $A$, in $B$, or in both. </p>

<p> If an event is in both, then it is "double counted" once in $P(A)$ and again in $P(B)$. </p>

<p>Subtract off the overlap ($A$ and $B$) once to remove the double counting.  </p>

<br>

<p> Example -- Roll a six-sided die.  What is the probability that you roll a 2 or an even number?
  <ul>
    <li> Rolling a 2 and rolling an even number are not mutually exclusive -- they can occur at the same time.
    <li> P(roll 2) = 1/6 and P(roll even) = 1/2 and P(roll 2 and roll even) = 1/6
    <li> P(roll 2 or roll even) = 1/6 + 1/2 - 1/6 = 1/2
</ul>





</section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
	<h2>Complement events</h2>


<ul class="spaced">
<li>Every event is in $A$ or $A^c$.  Together they are the entire sample space. </li>
<ul>
<li> $P(A \text{ or } A^c) = 1$
</ul>

<li> $A$ and $A^c$ are mutually exclusive events -- they cannot occur at the same time</li>
<ul>
  <li> $P(A \text{ and } A^c) = 0$
    <li> $P(A \text{ or } A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$
</ul>

<li>$A$ and $A^c$ are not independent events -- the probability of one does depend on whether the other occurred</li>
<ul>
  <li> $P(A \text{ and } A^c) \neq P(A) \times  P(A^c)$
</ul>

      <h2>Check your understanding</h2>

      <p>$A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events with $P(A) = 0.2$ and $P(B) = 0.3$.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Find $P(A \text{ and } B)$.

      <ul class="fragment spaced">
        <li class="green">$P(A \text{ and } B) = 0$
      </ul>

      <li>Find $P(A | B)$.

        <ul class="fragment spaced">
      <li class="green">$P(A | B) = \dfrac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)} = 0$
        </ul>

        <li>Find $P(A \text{ or } B) $.

        <ul class="fragment spaced">
          <li class="green">$P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.5$
        </ul>

        <li>Is it possible to have two mutually exclusive events with $P(A) = 0.7$ and $P(B) = 0.4$

        <ul class="fragment spaced">
          <li class="green">No.  Two mutually exclusive events with these probabilities would have $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1.1$.  No probability can be more than $1$.  
        </ul>


        </ul>
