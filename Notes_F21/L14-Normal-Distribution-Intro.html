	<h2>Continuous Random Variable</h2>

<p>A continuous random variable is a random process that can produce any decimal number in a given range as an outcome. </p>

<br>
<p> Example

<p> Select a random animal and record its weight

<p> Select a random student and record their height</p>

<br>
<p> With continuous random variables, we don't talk about the probability of a single value, but the probability that an outcome is in a given interval of values.

</section>

  <!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section class="left">
<h2>Normal Distribution</h2>

<p> The most common type of continuous random variable is called a normal distribution.

<p> Normal distributions appear commonly in practice.

<p> Normal distributions are unimodal (mound shape) and symmetric.
  <ul> <li>This shape tells us the mean, median, and mode are all the same.
</ul>

<p>Normal distributions have other properties, which we'll learn about.


<p> Caution: Other distributions can have the same shape (mound, symmetric), but are not normal distributions. (We'll use the t-distribution later in this class.)

	<h2>Normal Distribution Graph </h2>

<p> All normal distributions look the same if we measure the $x$-axis using standard deviations.

	<h2>Normal Distribution Probability</h2>

<p> We view the probability as the area of a certain region under the normal curve.

<h2>Example</h2>

<p> Assume a continuous random variable $x$ has a normal distribution with mean $50$ and standard deviation $6$.</p>

<p> $68\%$ of the values are between $50-6$ and $50+6$, so between $44$ and $56$
<ul><li> The probability of selecting a random value between $44$ and $56$ is $68\%$
</li></ul>
</p>
<p> $95\%$ of the values are between $50 - 2*6$ and $50 + 2*6$, so between $38$ and $62$
  <ul><li> The probability of selecting a random value between $38$ and $62$ is $95\%$
  </li></ul>
</p>
<p> $99.7\%$ of the values are between $50 - 3*6$ and $50 + 3*6$, so between $32$ and $68$
  <ul><li> The probability of selecting a random value between $32$ and $68$ is $99.7\%$
  </li></ul>
</section>

	<h2>Example</h2>

<p> Assume a continuous random variable $x$ has a normal distribution with mean $50$ and standard deviation $6$.</p>

Find the probability that the value is between $38$ and $56$

<img src="Figures/Normal-Distributions-Ex3.png" width="80%"></img>

\[P(38 \leq x \leq 56) = 13.5 + 34 + 34 = 81.5\% \]
</section>

<!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section class="left">
<h2>Example</h2>

<p> Assume a continuous random variable $x$ has a normal distribution with mean $50$ and standard deviation $6$.</p>

Find the probability that the value is more than one standard deviation from the mean

<img src="Figures/Normal-Distributions-Ex1.png" width="50%"></img>

<p> Caution! Be careful with the left and right tails, above and below 3 standard deviations.  Use subtraction.

\[P(x \leq 44 \text{ or } x \geq 56) = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32 = 32\%\]

<h2>Example</h2>

<p> Assume a continuous random variable $x$ has a normal distribution with mean $50$ and standard deviation $6$.</p>

Find the probability that the value is larger than $56$

<img src="Figures/Normal-Distributions-Ex2.png" width="50%"></img>

<p> Caution! Be careful with the left and right tails, above and below 3 standard deviations.  Use subtraction.

<p> First compute probability that value is more than three standard deviations above mean (right tail only).  Use subtraction and divide by 2.
  \[P(x \geq 68 ) = (100 - 99.7) / 2 = 0.15\% \]

<p> Now use addition
  \[P(x \geq 56) = 13.5 + 2.35 + 0.15 = 16\% \]

<h2>Check your understanding</h2>

<p>Assume a continuous random variable $x$ has a normal distribution with mean $12$ and standard deviation $2.5$.</p>

<ul>
<li>Find two values so that the probability of selecting a value between them is $68\%$.

<ul class="fragment spaced">
  <li class="green"> $9.5$ and $14.5$ -- within one standard deviation
</ul>

<li>Find two values so that the probability of selecting a value between them is $95\%$.

<ul class="fragment spaced">
  <li class="green">$7$ and $17$ -- within two standard deviations
</ul>

<li>Find two values so that the probability of selecting a value between them is $99.7\%$.

  <ul class="fragment spaced">
<li class="green">$4.5$ and $19.5$ -- within three standard deviations
  </ul>

  <li>True or false: the probability of selecting a value of $12$ or higher is $50\%$.

    <ul class="fragment spaced">
  <li class="green">True
    </ul>

  </ul>

<h2>Checking Claims </h2>

<p> Assume a continuous random variable $x$ has a normal distribution with mean $50$ and standard deviation $6$.</p>


<p> I select a random value, 41 from this distribution.</p>

<p> How many standard deviations is 41 from the mean?
  \[ \frac{41 - 50}{6} = -1.5\]
41 is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean.
</p>

<br>
<p> If I selected $3$ random values from this distribution and they all turned out to be $41$, would you be skeptical of the values of the mean and standard deviation?

<p> A small, but significant, percentage of the values should be around $41$; it should be possible to randomly select $3$ of this value.  I would not be skeptical.

<h2>Checking Claims </h2>

<p> Assume a continuous random variable $x$ has a normal distribution with mean $50$ and standard deviation $6$.</p>


<p> I select a random value, 74 from this distribution.</p>

<p> How many standard deviations is 74 from the mean?
  \[ \frac{74 - 50}{6} = 4\]
74 is 4 standard deviations above the mean.
</p>

<br>
<p> If I selected $3$ random values from this distribution and they all turned out to be $74$, would you be skeptical of the values of the mean and standard deviation?

<p> It is very unlikely, though possible, to select a value of 74; it would be even more unlikely to select 3 such values.  I would be skeptical.
