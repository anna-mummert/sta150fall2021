<h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>

<p> We compare a (sample) statistic to a pedetermined value.  We know the values are not the same.  We want to know if the difference is <i>signficant</i>.</p>
<br>

<p> The <b>null hypothesis</b> is that the difference in the numbers is due to chance.  Notation: $H_0$.

<ul><li> The numbers are not really different.  The difference between the two numbers is 0.  </ul>

<p> The <b>alternative hypothesis</b> (or research hypothesis) is that the difference is not due to chance.  The difference is significant.  Notation: $H_1$ (or $H_a$).
<ul><li> The numbers are really different.  The difference between the two numbers is not 0.  </ul>
</p>

<br>
<p> Use the sample data as evidence to support one of the two hypotheses.


</section>

<!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section class="left">
<h2>Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h2>

<p> Write the null hypothesis as "the mean equals [value]"

<p> The alternative hypothesis could be
  <ul>
  <li> "the mean is not equal to [value]"
  <li> "the mean is greater than [value]"
  <li> "the mean is less than [value]"
  </ul>
</p>

<br>
<p> Example: A medical trial is conducted to test wheter or not a new medicine reduces cholesterol by $25\%$.

<p> Null hypothesis: the new medicine reduces cholsterol by $25\%$
  \[H_0: \mu = 25\%\]

  <p> Alternative hypothesis: the new medicine does not reduces cholsterol by $25\%$ \[H_1: \mu \neq 25\%\]


</section>

  <!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section class="left">
<h2>Outcomes</h2>

<p> Use the sample data as evidence to support one of the two hypotheses.

<p> Sample data supports the null hypothesis, we say
<ul><li> Do not reject the null hypothesis.  Data does not suppport the claim of the alternative hypothesis.  </ul>

<p> Sample data supports the alternative hypothesis, we say
<ul><li> Reject the null hypothesis.  Data does suppport the claim of the alternative hypothesis.  </ul>


  <ul>

</section>

<!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section class="left">
<h2>Evidence </h2>

<p> Use the sample data as evidence to support one of the two hypotheses.

<p> Compute the $z$ value for the sample mean $\overline{x}$ using the
  <ul> <li> hypothesized value as the population mean $\mu$
<li> the standard deviation of the sampling mean $\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
</ul>
\[z = (\overline{x} - \mu) / \left(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \]

<p> Compute the probability for the $z$-value
  <ul> <li> probability large, then data supports null hypothesis ($\overline{x}$ and $\mu$ are close; hypothesized value $\mu$ is likely)
<li> probability small, then data supports alternative hypothesis ($\overline{x}$ and $\mu$ are very different; hypothesized value is unlikely)
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p> The mean work week for engineers in a company is believed to be about 60 hours.  A newly hired engineer hopes that it's shorter.  The work week of 10 engineers from the company are
  \[45 \quad 50 \quad 55 \quad 55 \quad 55 \quad 55 \quad 60 \quad 60 \quad 65\quad 70 \]
Based on the data should the new engineer count on the mean work week to be shorter than 60 hours?

<p> The length of engineer work weeks at this company is known to be normally distributed with a standard deviation of 6 hours.

  <h2>Example</h2>


    \[45 \quad 50 \quad 55 \quad 55 \quad 55 \quad 55 \quad 60 \quad 60 \quad 65\quad 70 \]

  <p> Find the sample average.   57 hours
    <ul> <li> The sample average is less than the hypothesized 60 hours.  Is it significantly less?</ul>

  <p> Null hypothesis: $H_0: \mu = 60$ hours

<p> Alternative hypothesis: $H_1: \mu < 60$ hours

<p> Compute the $z$-value
  \[z = (57 - 60) / \left(\frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}\right) = -1.58 \]

<p> Compute $P(z < -1.58)$ -- use the same "less than" as in the alternative hypothesis
  \[ P(z < -1.58) = 0.0571 \]
    </section>

    <h2>Example</h2>


    <p> Null hypothesis: $H_0: \mu = 60$ hours

  <p> Alternative hypothesis: $H_1: \mu < 60$ hours

<p> We computed the probability as
    \[ P(z < -1.58) = 0.0571 \]

<p> Does the evidence support the null hypothesis (is $p$ large) or the alternative hypothesis (is $p$ small)?

<p> Typically,  you have in mind a preset "level of significance" $\alpha$ that you compare your $p$-value against.
<ul>
<li>  If $p > \alpha$ then data supports null hypothesis (do not reject the null hypothesis).
<li>If $p < \alpha$ then data supports alternative hypothesis (reject the null hypothesis).
</ul>
      </section>

<!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section class="left">
<h2>One-sided and Two-sided Tests </h2>

<p> One-sided test -- the alternative hypothesis is "less than" or "greater than".
<ul> <li> For "less than", read the $p$-value directly from the $Z$ table
  <li> For "greater than", find the probability and subtract : $1 - p$.
</ul>

<p> Two-sided test -- the alternative hypothesis is "not equal to"
  <ul> <li> If $z < 0$, find the probability and multiply by 2 : $2p$.
    <li> If $z > 0$, find the probability, subtract, and multiply by 2 : $2(1-p)$.
  </ul>
</p>

<br>
<p> Hypothesis testing SPSS
  <ul> <li> Always uses the Student's t-test (assumes population standard deviation unknown)
    <li> Always gives two sided $p$-value.
      <ul> <li> Divide the two sided value by 2, to get the one-sided value
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>Check your understanding</h2>

  <p>Write the null and alternative hypotheses for each scenario.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>We want to test whether the mean height of eighth graders is 66 inches.

  <ul class="fragment spaced">
    <li class="green"> Null hypothesis: The mean height of eighth graders is 66 inches.  $H_0: \mu = 66$ inches</li>
    <li class="green"> Alternative hypothesis: The mean height of eighth graders is not 66 inches.  $H_1: \mu \neq 66$ inches</li>
  </ul>

  <li>We want to test if college students take less than five years to graduate from college, on the average.

  <ul class="fragment spaced">
    <li class="green"> Null hypothesis: On average, college students take five years to graduate from college.  $H_0: \mu = 5$ years</li>
    <li class="green"> Alternative hypothesis: On average, college students take less than five years to graduate from college.  $H_1: \mu < 5$ years</li>
  </ul>
