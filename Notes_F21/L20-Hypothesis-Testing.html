<h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>

<p> General process


<ul class = "spaced">
  <li> Identify the hypothesis you want to test.  <b>Null hypothesis</b> the two values are equal.  <b>Alternative hypothesis</b> the values are different $>$, $<$, or $\neq$.
  <li> Identify the <b>level of significance</b> $\alpha$ you want to use.
  <li> Convert the sample statistic into a $z$-value
  <li> Compute the probability $p$-value of getting a sample as extreme or more extreme than our sample.
  <li> If the probability is lower than the level of significance we say <b>reject</b> the null hypothesis and <b>accept</b> the alternative hypothesis ($p < \alpha$).  Otherwise, we say the evidence is not strong enough to reject the null hypothesis ($p > \alpha$).
</ul>


</section>

<!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section class="left">
<h2>One-sided and Two-sided Tests </h2>

<p> One-sided test -- the alternative hypothesis is "less than" or "greater than".
<ul> <li> For "less than", read the $p$-value directly from the $Z$ table
  <li> For "greater than", find the probability and subtract : $1 - p$.
</ul>

<p> Two-sided test -- the alternative hypothesis is "not equal to"
  <ul> <li> If $z < 0$, find the probability and multiply by 2 : $2p$.
    <li> If $z > 0$, find the probability, subtract, and multiply by 2 : $2(1-p)$.
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p> The mean work week for engineers in a company is believed to be about 60 hours.  A newly hired engineer hopes that it's shorter.  The work week of 10 engineers from the company are
  \[45 \quad 50 \quad 55 \quad 55 \quad 55 \quad 55 \quad 60 \quad 60 \quad 65\quad 70 \]
Based on the data should the new engineer count on the mean work week to be shorter than 60 hours?

<p> The length of engineer work weeks at this company is known to be normally distributed with a standard deviation of 6 hours.

<p> Use a level of significance $\alpha = 0.1$

</section>

<!-- -------------------------------- -->
<section class="left">
<h2>Example</h2>


<p> Null hypothesis: $H_0: \mu = 60$ hours

<p> Alternative hypothesis: $H_1: \mu < 60$ hours

<p> Compute the $z$-value: $z = -1.58$

<p> Compute the $p$-value: $P(z < -1.58) = 0.0571$

<p> Compare $p$ and $\alpha$: $0.0571 < 0.1$

<p> Because the $p$ value is less than the significance level $\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.

<p> The data supports the claim that the average work week at this company is less than 60 hours.

    <h2>Example</h2>

<p> It is believed that a stock price for a particular company will grow at a rate of $\$5$ per week with a standard deviation of $\$2$.  An investor does not believe this claim.

<p> The changes in stock price is recorded for ten weeks and are as follows
  \[2 \quad 3 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 5 \quad 6 \quad 7\quad 8 \quad 10 \]

<p> It is believed that the growth rate of the stock is normally distributed.

<p> Perform a hypothesis test using a $5\%$ level of significance.

</section>

  <!-- -------------------------------- -->
  <section class="left">
  <h2>Example</h2>

    <p> Null hypothesis: $H_0: \mu = 5$ dollars

  <p> Alternative hypothesis: $H_1: \mu \neq 5$ dollars

<p> Compute the sample mean $\overline{x} = 5.3$

<p> Compute the $z$-value
    \[ z = (5.3 - 5)/ \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{10}}\right) = 0.47\]

<p> From the $Z$ table, $P(z < 0.47) = 0.6808$

      </section>

      <!-- -------------------------------- -->
      <section class="left">
      <h2>Example</h2>

    <p> From the $Z$ table, $P(z < 0.47) = 0.6808$

    <p> Subtract from $1$ to find the probability of another sample having a mean larger than our sample mean $5.3$.  \[1 - 0.6808 = 0.3152\]

    <p> Multiply by two to find the $p$-value: $p = 0.6304$

  <p> Compare the $p$-value with the significance level $\alpha$
    \[0.6304 > 0.05 \]

  <p> Do not reject the null hypothesis.  The evidence supports the claim that the weekly growth rate of the stock is $\$5$.

    <h2>Check your understanding</h2>

    <p>Make a conclusion for each of the hypothesis tests at the $5\%$ level of significance.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>We want to test whether the mean height of eighth graders is 66 inches. <br> The null and alternative hypothese are <br> $H_0: \mu = 66$ inches and $H_1: \mu \neq 66$ inches. <br>
      You compute the $p$-value and find $p = 0.46$.

    <ul class="fragment spaced">
      <li class="green">Do not reject the null hypothesis.  The data supports the claim that the mean height of eighth graders is 66 inches.
    </ul>

    <li>We want to test if college students take less than five years to graduate from college, on the average. <br>  The null and alternative hypotheses are <br> $H_0: \mu = 5$ years and $H_1: \mu < 5$ years.  <br>
      You compute the $p$-value and find $p = 0.02$.

    <ul class="fragment spaced">
      <li class="green">Reject the null hypothesis.  The data supports the claim that, on average, college students take less than five years to graduate from college.
    </ul>

      </ul>
